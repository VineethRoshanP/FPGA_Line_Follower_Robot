# FPGA_Line_Follower_Robot
Interfaced De0 Nano FPGA Board using Quartus Prime and Verilog with a TCS3200 Color Sensor, UART with HC05 Bluetooth module, and Line Following Array. Moreover, a single cycle RV321 ISA RISC-V CPU was implemented in order to execute a low memory (256 Bytes) pathfinding algorithm for IIT-B's eYantra Competition.
